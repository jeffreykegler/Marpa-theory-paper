THIS REPOSITORY IS NOT BEING UPDATED

This was the repository for the revision of the Marpa "Theory paper":
The paper formally describing the parsing theory behind Marpa.

The theory paper "revision" grew to the point where the "paper" is now
a "book", and at that point a new repository was started.  All updates
are going to the Marpa book repository.
